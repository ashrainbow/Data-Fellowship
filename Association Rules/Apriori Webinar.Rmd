title: "Association Rules"

if lift equals 1 they are independant of each other
if lift > 1 there is an assosiation and if someone likes x then they are more likely to like y

# 1. Overview
This Notebook wants to utilise association rules to make a holiday recommendation system. We will use Apriori algorithm.

# 2. Import and load libraries
The 'arules' library includes lots of functions and algorithms to mine datasets for associations.

```{R}
install.packages('arules')
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('arulesViz')
install.packages('reshape')
library('tidyverse')
library('arules')
library('arulesViz')
library('reshape')
```

# 3. Import Data

```{R}
data <- read.csv('Destination Recommendations - Open_coh_download.csv')
head(data)
```

# 4. Transform the data
In association rules algorithms the dataframe needs to be of a specific type: TRANSACTION

```{R}
data <- as(data, "transactions")
```

# 5. Look at the data

```{R}
head(data)
```

```{R}
summary(data)
```

```{R}
inspect(data[1:3])
```

# 6. Visualise the data
Use arulesViz

```{R}
itemFrequencyPlot(data, topN = 10, type = 'absolute')
```

# 7. Apriori
Use arules

```{R}
# create rules for most frequent item sets
rules = apriori(data = data, parameter = list(support = 0.1, confidence = 0.2, minlen = 3), control = list(verbose = FALSE))
```

```{R}
rules = sort(rules, by = 'support', decreasing = TRUE)
```

# 8. Inspect the transactions
```{R}
inspect(rules[1:20])
```
